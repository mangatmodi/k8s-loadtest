alt-scripts
========

This repository is dedicated to scripts that will be run manually for one time tasks, and won't keep any data.

# Usage

For each new script, please create a folder with the script, a README with basic documentation and example config files

# Rules

The scripts should never contain any form of config (URL, user/passowrd...)

*Use the best language for the task !*

- Go (default)
- Bash (for very, very simple tasks)
- Python ( existing script, super library)
